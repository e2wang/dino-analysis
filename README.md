# Evolutionary Data Analysis of Dinosaur Characteristics
## Overview
Our project aims to evaluate the best evolutionary charasteristics for dinosaurs to survive during the Mesozoic Era, specifically across three periods: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. By looking at attributes such as diet, number of legss, and other features, this project offers a more holistic understanding to the discussion of Paleontology and Evolutionary Biology by incorporating Data Science and building upon the sparse dinosaur datasets currently available.

## Usage
Use `analysis_by_period.ipynb` to analyze the dinosaur characteristics by time period. Use `Overall Analysis.ipynb` to analyze the dinosaur characteristics across all three time periods.
