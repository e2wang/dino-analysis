# Evolutionary Data Analysis of Dinosaur Characteristics
## Overview
Our project aims to evaluate the best evolutionary charasteristics for dinosaurs to survive during the Mesozoic Era, specifically across three periods: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. By looking at attributes such as diet, ornamentation (e.g. beaks, talons, spikes), number of legs, and other features, this project offers a more holistic understanding to the discussion of Paleontology and Evolutionary Biology by incorporating Data Science and building upon the sparse dinosaur datasets currently available.
